C Synthesis, Cosimulation, and RTL Export > Evaluate Verilog report show this block meets utilization and timing requirements. However, for unknown reasons it did not work on hardware when instantiated with RX Filter, FPLL (or RX Filter-FPLL), DC Blocker, AGC (or DC Blocker-AGC), Viterbi, and Deinterleaver. A critical warning on timing could potentially (and randomly) occur but Reed-Solomon v2 has also shown to not work with no critical warnings reported with all those blocks instantiated. It seems that when more CEs are instantiated, there is a higher chance of critical warnings on timing and/or CEs not working when they otherwise would if less CEs were instantiated. However, Reed-Solomon v2 has been verified to work on hardware when it was the only CE instantiated along with a DDC and 8 FIFOs filled in the image. This version is ~10x faster in throughput (~1/10 the initiation interval) than the version checked into the main rfnoc tree.
